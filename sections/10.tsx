                The Singapore government has set on a long-term vision of achieving net-zero emissions, which includes reducing pollution from transport. The sector currently accounts for up to 15% of the countryâ€™s total carbon emissions.

                Go-Ahead Singapore has stepped up by turning to big data analytics to optimise its operations. Hitachi supported Go-Ahead Singapore in measuring and improving their bus operation efficiency through the development and maintenance of a customised big data analytics web portal. This enabled scheduling staff to swiftly identify issues and resolve them promptly. Paired with accurate traffic data, Go-Ahead is able to deploy their buses more effectively. This reduces bus idling time in congested streets and lower vehicle exhaust emissions.

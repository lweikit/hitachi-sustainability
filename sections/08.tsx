                Thailandâ€™s delivery market was projected to grow by 35% in 2020 due to the rapid growth of e-commerce. Such rapid growth has serious implications for sustainability efforts, as the transport sector accounts for the second largest emission of greenhouse gases. To mitigate the environmental impacts, Hitachi has launched a vehicle sharing service in Thailand. The launch of its live-tracking system will enable companies to locate and reserve vehicles to reduce the number of empty trucks on Thai roads. An optimised logistics system means lower carbon emissions in Thailand, a direct contribution to the decarbonisation goals of COP26.
